# nand2tetris
Projects for course CS2300 IIT Madras (Foundations of Computer System Design), inspired from the course named nand2tetris on coursera.


These are my projects for the Nand2Tetris course. You can find most of the projects in there respective folders.

I have written assembler and vmTranslator in C++ and Compiler in Python (with standard libraries).

The final version of the compiler is [here](https://github.com/ravigupta2323/nand2tetris/tree/master/projects/11/CS18B043). [Here](https://github.com/ravigupta2323/nand2tetris/blob/master/projects/11/Instructions.pdf) is a link to Instructions pdf whcih explains how the compiler script works.

Have Fun!
